In a previous post, I showed how we can collect data to find what makes a board game popular. In this post, we'll use python to explore that data.

As a reminder, all data comes from BoardGamesGeek!

# What is in our data?

# What are the breakdowns of each factor in our data?
- use grid to display multiple histograms at once
- one for numerical and one for categorical

# How are different variables related?
- show correlation matrix

# How are ratings distributed across different factors?
- use grid to show multiple volin plots

# How are number of reviews distributed?

# How do ratings change compared to the age of the game?
- use line graph to show this (year x rating)

# Are there any outliers? Does taking these outliers out of the data change the analysis?
