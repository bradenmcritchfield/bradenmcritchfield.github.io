Everyone loves a good board game. Board games bring people together, offer intellectual stimulation, and provide a form of entertainment that is not tied to a screen. But what makes a board game popular? 

To explore this question, first we need to find data on popular board games.

# Data Source
One great source of board game data is [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/). This website is an online database and community for those who love board games. Not only does it have information about hundreds and thousands of board and card games, but it also allows users to rate and sell board games on the website. Because of this, we can find data about each board game's requirements, it's popularity, and it's value.

BoardGameGeek offers an api that allows the user to access data on a game by game basis. Before accessing the api, it's best to check the [Terms of Service](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/XML_API_Terms_of_Use#). The good news is that we are able to use this data for non-commercial use. We just need to credit Board Games Geek by including its logo in public facing uses of the api.

So all credit for this data is given to BoardGameGeek. Here is their logo:
